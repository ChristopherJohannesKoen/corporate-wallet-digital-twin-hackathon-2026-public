"""Freeze V3.1.1 as the regression boundary V3.2 builds on.

V3.2 adds a Promotion Readiness Twin *alongside* the Wallet and Decision Twins.
"Alongside" is only a meaningful claim if there is a recorded boundary to compare
against, so this captures what V3.1.1 actually produced — provenance, artifact
digests and the analytical surface — before any V3.2 code exists.

The record deliberately states what was **not** established as prominently as what
was. A boundary that only lists successes cannot be used to detect a later
regression in the things that were still open.
