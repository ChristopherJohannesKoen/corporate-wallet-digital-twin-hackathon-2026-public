"""Export the V3.2 promotion JSON Schemas and the gate catalogue.

The catalogue is exported as data rather than living only in code, for the same
reason the gates were moved out of ``ShadowReleaseGate``: a control nobody can
read is a control nobody can review. Unlike
``config/mlflow_promotion_policy.json`` — which declared gate ids that no code
ever parsed — this file is generated *from* the catalogue the engine uses, so
the published document and the enforced policy cannot drift apart.
