"""Deployable service boundaries for the composed V3.1 microservice topology.

The reference build deliberately shares one Python distribution so contract and
control code cannot drift. Each EKS deployment selects one ASGI object below;
only routes owned by that service are registered in its OpenAPI document.
Service-owned persistence remains an adapter concern and cross-service database
access is prohibited by the deployment policies in ``infra``.
