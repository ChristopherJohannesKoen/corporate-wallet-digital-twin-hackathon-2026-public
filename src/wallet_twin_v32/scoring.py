"""Two scores, kept apart on purpose.

**PMR — Promotion Machinery Readiness.** Does the promotion apparatus work? Do
gates fire, does evidence bind, do signatures verify, do injected incidents
reset the counters they should? Computed on the rehearsal track, where
synthetic evidence is exactly what ought to count.

**BER — Bank Evidence Readiness.** Does the *bank* have the evidence? Computed
on the real track, where synthetic evidence contributes **zero**.

There is deliberately no third number combining them. A composite would let a
PMR near 1.0 pull a BER of 0.0 up to a comfortable-looking middle, and a reader
skimming one figure would come away believing the system is halfway to
production when the bank has authorised nothing at all. The two numbers
disagreeing *is* the finding — averaging them destroys it.

``synthetic_weight_excluded_from_ber`` makes the gap explicit: it is the gate
weight that passes under simulation and has no real-track support. Publishing it
turns "BER is low" into "here is precisely how much of this readiness is
simulated".
