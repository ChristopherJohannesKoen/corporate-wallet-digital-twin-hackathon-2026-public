"""Corporate Wallet Digital Twin V3.2 — Promotion Readiness Twin.

V3.2 extends V3.1 rather than replacing it. V2 remains the governed evidence and
economics substrate, V3 the latent-structure layer, V3.1 the decision object a
banker acts on — and V3.2 adds the question none of them can answer:

    Is this system allowed to be used, and for what?

Every gate is evaluated twice. The **REAL** track governs actual bank
authorisation. The **REHEARSAL** track proves the promotion machinery works.
Keeping them apart is the entire design: a rehearsal in which every gate passes
demonstrates that the apparatus functions and demonstrates nothing whatever
about whether a bank has approved anything.

Three properties hold by construction rather than by convention:

- Synthetic evidence cannot support a real-track verdict. The type refuses it,
  the mode algebra refuses it, and the trust registry refuses to sign it.
- Synthetic evidence contributes zero to Bank Evidence Readiness, so a fully
  rehearsed system scores zero on the number that describes the bank.
- PMR and BER are never combined. A composite would let a working rehearsal
  read as progress toward production, which is the precise misreading this twin
  exists to prevent.

Bank production status remains ``NOT_PROMOTABLE``.
