"""V3.2 promotion contracts.

House style from :mod:`wallet_twin_v2.contracts` throughout: ``StrictModel``
(``extra="forbid"``, ``validate_assignment=True``), enums kept as enums, and
governance invariants expressed as ``model_validator`` rather than as
documentation. If a combination would be a misrepresentation, constructing it
raises — a downstream check can be forgotten, a constructor cannot.

**The four time fields.** They are not interchangeable and collapsing any two of
them loses a distinction the bank needs:

``as_of``
    The business date the evidence describes. The point-in-time boundary: no
    input dated after this may have informed it.
``generated_at``
    Wall-clock time the artifact was computed. Provenance, not business meaning.
``published_at``
    When it became visible to consumers. Later than ``generated_at`` whenever
    review sits between the two, which is the normal case for attested evidence.
``simulation_clock``
    Position of the *virtual* clock. Present only for rehearsal evidence, and
    the reason an accelerated 30-day rehearsal cannot be read as 30 elapsed
    days: the field that advanced is named differently from the ones that did
    not.

``expires_at`` is a fifth, orthogonal field: freshness, not occurrence.
