"""The promotion gate catalogue: governed data, not hardcoded checks.

Three things were wrong with how gates existed before V3.2.

1. ``ShadowReleaseGate`` hardcodes twenty checks in a single method with string
   thresholds, no evidence binding, no owner, and no statement of what failure
   costs. It can compute a verdict; it cannot explain one.
2. ``config/mlflow_promotion_policy.json`` declares gate ids for exactly two
   transitions — ``candidate_to_shadow`` and ``shadow_to_champion`` — and **no
   code ever parses it**. ``production_target.py`` only greps it for substrings.
   A policy nothing reads is a document, not a control.
3. The two vocabularies share no identifiers. ``release_gates.py`` says
   ``interval-coverage-90``; the MLflow policy says
   ``90pct_coverage_between_85pct_and_95pct``. The same requirement under two
   names cannot be reconciled by anything but a human reading both.

This module fixes all three: one catalogue, five transitions, machine-read,
with each gate carrying its legacy identifiers so the older artifacts remain
traceable rather than being silently orphaned.
